This development board provides a small plate with the same powerful microcontroller. It is compatible with Arduino and ideal for fast prototyping and easy integration. It’s vital for your small project where you don’t need much of a pin-outs but the small size is very important to make it look good. The board equips a low-cost USB-Serial Chip that makes it less in price than Nano with FTDI USB-Serial Chip used on older versions of Arduino Nano. The Nano is a small, complete, and breadboard-friendly board based on the ATmega328. It lacks only a DC power jack and works with a Type-C cable instead of a standard one.\n\nThe board can be powered via the Type-C connection, 6-12V unregulated external power supply (pin 30), or 5V regulated external power supply (pin 27). The power source is automatically selected as the highest voltage source. The size of the board is only 43 mm x 18 mm, it comes with 6 PWM I/O from a total of 14 digitals I/O, 8 analog inputs, 16Mhz clock speed, and 32kB of flash memory. It can be programmed directly from the Arduino IDE, using the Type-C connection.\n\nNote: This board is a 100% compatible clone version with the same design as Arduino Nano But Type-C. It is not the original version which is made in Italy. CH340 chip might not work directly with some PC/Laptop, you will need some CH340 drivers.\n\nSpecifications\nProcessor: ATmega328\nWorking voltage: 5V\nInput voltage (recommended): 7-12V\nInput voltage (range): 6-20V\nDigital IO pins: 14 (6 of which are used as PWM outputs) (D0~D13)\nAnalog input pins: 6 (A0~A5)\nIO pin DC current: 40mA\nFlash Memory: 32KB\nSRAM: 2KB\nEEPROM: 1KB (ATmega328)\nWorking clock: 16 MHZ\nType-C\nPCB Size: 43mm x
